            As I have mentioned before, one of my hobbies is building, and I especially enjoy building vheciles. My top three projects that you will see shortly, are all differnent
            <br> forms of transportation, that I have either modified, or built by hand. I've put countless hours into each of these projects, 
            <br> and I'm excited to show you the work that I've done. Enjoy!
