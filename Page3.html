        <br>
        <p class=intro>
            Although the DIY OneWheel, was a short lived project, It is still one of my favorites. Around the start of quarentine I found myself with a lot of freetime, and
            <br> I had been going on frequent walks. On one of these walks I saw somone riding a hoverboard, and that remineded me of an old project I had seen
            <br> online. By utilizing the the motors, gyroscope, battery, and motherboard from the hoverboard, you could create a one-wheeled self-balencing
            <br> SkateBoard, or commercially known as the OneWheel. After rembering the project the flame was reignited, and I immedatly began collecting 
            <br>parts, and planning the build.
