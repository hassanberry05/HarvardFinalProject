     <p id=intro>
        Saving the best project for last, I now present Porject #3 or my project car. This car started off its life as a 2007 Toyota Fj Cruiser,
        <br> and my father oringally purchased the car a few years back due to the harsh winters up here in Michigan.The plan was for me to 
        <br> take ownership of the car when I get my drivers license, and knowing this I set out to make the car as modern looking, and funtional 
        <br> as possible. Below is the list of modification, that I've installed on the car.
